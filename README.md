# DART - FARM

Welcome to DART-FARM, a fork of the **Data Assimilation Research Testbed** that includes the Chemical Transport Model **FARM**

[FARM model](http://www.farm-model.org/)

[FORAIR-IT model](https://clima.sostenibilita.enea.it/research/FORAIR-IT)

[The DART documentation is available online](https://dart-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

There is a mailing list where we summarize updates to the DART repository and notify users about 
recent bug fixes. It is not generally used for discussion so it's a low-traffic list. 
To subscribe to the list, click on [Dart-users](http://mailman.ucar.edu/mailman/listinfo/dart-users).
